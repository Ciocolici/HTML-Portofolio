<h1>The Best Movies According to Cioco</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Yes Man</h3>
<p>It is a life lesson.<br/>The world is a playground, but it seems we forgot it.<br/>I also really love Jim Carrey. ^^</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Although not a film, but a series, it is probably the best trilogy ever made.<br/>I also love fantasy movies a lot.</p>
<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3>
<p>Also a series of movies instead of one movie, there is something special about it.<br/>From the characters, to the universe, everything is so well done.<br/>There was not a minute of boredom watching any of the GotG movies.</p>
